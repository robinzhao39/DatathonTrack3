# DatathonTrack3

This is Datathon Track3 done by the Matrix. In the data folder, raw India rainfall data from year 1651 to 2015 is included, which needs to be extracted 
to be used for analysis. In the Indian Rainfall Data Cleaning and Analysis notebook, data extracting is done, and an analysis of India rainfall trend with
predictive models is done afterwards. In addition, a qgis containing rainfall aggregated to the district level in 1981 is made, having the ability to be transfered
and used directly for other researches. Finally, a gdb repository is included, containing maps of kernel density analysis in decade intervals that show how
rainfall changes in India from 1951 to 1990, which again, is ready to be transfered and reused in other researches.
